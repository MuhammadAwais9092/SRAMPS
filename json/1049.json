Children aged four are admitted to LKG. All children seeking admission in any grade are required to appear in an entrance exam that is held by the school\u2019s admission committee. The schedule is announced in time so that the parents can plan for their presence in the school with their children. The entrance exam is designed based on the concepts of the grade the candidate is seeking admission in; also, on the acquired skills of the previous grade level. The test contains basic skills of the previous grade and the admission committee (AC) expects that the candidate will acquire a minimum 60% passing grade. The qualified candidates are then interviewed by the Section Coordinator to ensure that the passing grade aligns with the knowledge of the candidate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidates who succeed in the admission process are offered admission and he\/she is provided with all the necessary options and documentation checklist that is required for the admission.
