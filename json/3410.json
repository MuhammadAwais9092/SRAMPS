We believe every child has unique abilities and needs, and our mission is to ensure that all students feel respected and have equal opportunities to thrive academically and personally. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <strong>Inclusion Department<\/strong> plays a central role in this mission by working closely with students, parents, and teachers. We recognize that some students require additional support to overcome challenges, and we are dedicated to meeting their individual needs through tailored strategies and programs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support provided by Learning Support Assistants (LSAs) is a key component of our Inclusion Department&#8217;s efforts. LSAs play a vital role in facilitating the learning journey of Students of<br>Determination by offering individualized support in and outside the classroom. Working closely with teachers and the Inclusion Team, LSAs ensure that each student receives the necessary assistance to meet their academic, social, and emotional needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Individual Education Plans (IEPs)<br><\/strong>We develop Individual Education Plans (IEPs) for students requiring personalized support, which address specific learning objectives, social development goals, and emotional well-being. These plans are collaboratively created with input from parents, teachers, and specialists to ensure that the child\u2019s unique needs are met effectively. Regular reviews are conducted to monitor<br>progress and adapt strategies as necessary, ensuring continuous growth and development. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs)<br><\/strong>Our department designs Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs) for students facing behavioral<br>challenges to provide structured strategies that help them succeed in school settings. These plans focus on understanding the root causes of behavior, fostering positive interactions, and equipping teachers and parents with tools to support the child in various environments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teacher and Parent Support<br><\/strong>We believe that collaboration is the key to success. Our Inclusion Department provides ongoing support and training for teachers to help them create inclusive classrooms that cater to diverse learning needs. Moreover, we engage with parents regularly to ensure they feel supported and involved in their child\u2019s educational journey. Workshops, meetings, and open communication channels are established to strengthen this partnership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At His Highness Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum Pakistani School Dubai, we are dedicated to ensuring that every child has access to a developed, supportive, and inclusive educational experience. Through our focused efforts and collaborative approach, we aim to empower all students to reach their full potential and become confident, contributing members of society.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>VisionTo create a welcoming, unbiased, and inclusive space where all students, regardless of theirneeds, backgrounds, or skills, feel valued, inspired, &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"_uf_show_specific_survey":0,"_uf_disable_surveys":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-3410","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry","latest_post"],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3410","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3410"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3410\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3415,"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3410\/revisions\/3415"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.sramps.sch.ae\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3410"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
